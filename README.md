# Project EcoSanitation

Project Ecosanitation is dedicated to transforming menstrual hygiene in India by empowering women with the knowledge and resources to embrace safe and sustainable menstrual practices. 
Our mission is to educate women on the importance of proper menstrual care, while promoting eco-friendly alternatives such as biodegradable sanitary pads.
Through impactful awareness campaigns, educational workshops, and accessible resources, we work to break the stigma surrounding menstruation, prioritize health, and safeguard the environment. By helping women make informed, sustainable choices, we are creating a healthier, more sustainable future for individuals and communities alike.
